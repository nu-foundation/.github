### Mission

### Vision 
Loving communities restoring the world through you & me. That Christians would find liberation through love.

### Aboutâ€¨
nuFoundation is a non-profit organization, co-founded by Adam Evers and Will Remigio in 2023. Born out of a shared frustration and commitment to change, we are a tech duo with a mission to disrupt religious trauma and foster inclusivity within Christian congregations, utilizing technology to bridge gaps and build connections.

We have developed a suite of technology products under the nuFoundation umbrella, all aimed at serving faith communities. Our key offerings include nu.community, a unique church 
search engine that allows individuals to find congregations that align with their values, qVault, a volunteer portal, and other tools. While we are powered by the spirit of volunteerism, we operate like a tech company, utilizing the latest technology and tools to drive our mission forward.

Our goal is to revolutionize the faith landscape by building an ecosystem where communities, resources, and events are inclusive, anti-racist, Jesus-loving, and social justice-oriented. We believe in leveraging the power of data and technology to achieve this goal, creating a world where faith and acceptance coexist harmoniously.
